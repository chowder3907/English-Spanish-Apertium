# English-Spanish-Apertium
This project is a bash script made to easily translate to and from English and Spanish using Apertium. I didn't want to remember commands and I figured this
would be a good personal introduction into deeper bash scripting. Both scripts function, although they only work on debian-based systems
or any system using apt. This can be easily changed and will be detailed later in the file.
